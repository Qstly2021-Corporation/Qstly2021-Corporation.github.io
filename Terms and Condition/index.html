                        <li> Subject to section 2.1(2), the person signing up for the Service by opening an Account will be the contracting party (“Store Owner”) for the purposes of our Terms of Service and will be the person who is authorized to use any corresponding
                            Account we may provide to the Store Owner in connection with the Service. You are responsible for ensuring that the name of the Store Owner (including the legal name of the company that owns the Store, if applicable) is clearly
                            visible on the Store’s website. If you are signing up for the Services on behalf of your employer, your employer shall be the Store Owner. If you are signing up for the Services on behalf of your employer, then you must use
                            your employer-issued email address and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind your employer to our Terms of Service. Your Qstly Store can only be associated with one Store Owner. A Store Owner may have
                            multiple Qstly Stores. “Store” means the online store or physical retail location(s) associated with the Account.

                            <br> <br> According to cart we don’t have an inventory but all items by preordered based on our agreement with you and also with the brand corporation so if you click on add to cart will send you an email of all details and
                            you can remove from your email because product if you will not buy at specific time may be finished from the market.
